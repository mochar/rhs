* Regularized horseshoe prior experiments

I implement regularized horseshoe priors in numpyro and train it with variational inference and MCMC. The main objective is to compare variations of the model:

- Guide structure :: Model correlations between coefficient and its local sparsity parameter
- Reparamerization :: Factorize half-cauchy prior into gamma and inverse-gamma distributions

** Guide structures 

** Reparameterizations
The global and feature-local sparsity parameters are modeled as Half-Cauchy distributions in the prior. This can challenge inference and is therefore proposed to be factorized into two seperate distributions.

*** InverseGamma-Gamma 

*** InverseGamma-InverseGamma
